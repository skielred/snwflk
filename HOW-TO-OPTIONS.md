Changing your theme colors
-------------
If you want to change colors, I suggest using the sheet for Snowflake Minima Black Fire as a base for your work.
You'll have to change various properties. To change the UI main color, search and replace `#AB2C2C` in the text with your own customized color. Replace all occurences of the color. Now, there is one thing left to do. Then, you'll have to change `rgba(157, 67, 67, 0.66)` and `rgba(157, 67, 67, 0.1)` to a color more befitting to the one you chose. We recommend you keep the `0.66` and `0.1` as they are.
